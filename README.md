# Business-Analytics-Coursework

# Introduction
This course has a 30%-weighted coursework component which will require you to use Tableau to create a story (a collection of dashboards) to discover commercial insights from a provided dataset. The purpose of the project is for you to demonstrate your ability to create effective data visualisations using Tableau to communicate key insights to senior management. The deadline for the coursework is listed in the submission section of the VLE. This individual project work is treated as an open-book examination.

# Deliverable content
Your task will be to explore the dataset using Tableau's data visualisation tools in an effort to extract commercially-important insights in preparation for a presentation of your findings to senior management of the company.

The deliverable content will be in two parts:

1. a story (a collection of five dashboards) created in Tableau
2. an accompanying 1,500-word report, which describes the key insights from the story, including recommendations to senior management as a result of your discoveries.
